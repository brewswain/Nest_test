# Recommended Folder Exploration Order

The folders are ordered to keep comments grouped together as best as possible to avoid over-verbosity.
`1_basic_structure` will likely be the most comment-heavy folder here, since it's going over basic flow etc.
the folders will have readme.md files placed at the top of each with a recc'd reading order. This is a good way to keep a track of the relevant files that were changed per folder.
